### Purpose of this Application

This Application was made for learning Asp.Net.

### Incomplete App

It's not complete yet, but maybe i will update and add some more functionality over time.
Some important things that are still missing are

- Documentation
- Changelog
- Git Flow
- Unit Tests (partially implemented but not complete)
- Better UX / UI experience
- Threading
- Role Management
- User Management
- Take Orders after products added to cart


### Live Preview

The whole App was published as an Azure Web App. You can test all implemented functionalities here:

https://purebakes.azurewebsites.net/

Please note that you need to be logged in as an admin to access the Product CRUD operations.
Login with these credentials to test it:

admin@gmail.com
password: Test123.

For all other functionalities, create a new account.

Please note that it's not possible for an admin to remove or edit base products that are already in the app.
For that, i have defined a super admin just for myself =)

But you can edit or remove all products that you have created
